          <h2 className="story__title"><span>The story </span><br/>of our snow monkeys</h2>
          <div className="story__discr">Our Snow Monkeys have traveled far to chill in their hot springs, but all is not what it seems, we have reports of missing monkeys reports of monkeys coming back different - when you join the Hot Springs, be sure to be careful.</div>
          <p className="story__text">“In the phantom-white mountains of Jigokudani, the Snowy Monkeys normally reside in a cold, unforgiving environment. The Snow Monkeys soon became exhausted from battling the harsh conditions of the mountain. Thus, the Monkeys began searching for a new sanctuary. In their adventures the Snow Monkeys discovered a secret refuge. Hidden behind a cloud of deliciously warm steam layed a glorious hot spring.</p><br/>
          <p className="story__text">In contrast to the numbing cold of the mountains, spring is a paradise. First the Monkeys only occasionally visited the spring, almost treating it as a retreat. But, eventually the Monkeys never left. Resisting the tranquil pools was just too punishing. The Snowy Monkeys now call the Hot volcanic springs of Jigokudani home.</p><br/>
          <p className="story__text">After settling into their new paradise the Snow Monkeys began transforming the pools into their own personalised haven. Now the volcanic pools have become hubs for like minded Monkeys who’s ideas put the world to rights.</p><br/>
          <p className="story__text">Even though they migrated to the Hot Springs in search of Zen and enlightenment the Snow Monkeys also love to party! In this social hub the Snow Monkeys often host parties and events for all on the blockchain to attend.</p><br/>
          <p className="story__text">However, the Monkey’s glorious volcanic club is not all sunshine and rainbows. There is a darker unexplored side to the hot springs.</p><br/>
          <p className="story__text">As the Monkeys used the hot springs more and more they began to realise every day the pools slowly were producing less heat. A small group of intelects within the Snow Monkey community theorised this is because the volcano needs fuel to keep consistently combusting and thus producing heat however couldn’t find the source.</p><br/>
          <p className="story__text">A small group of radical Snow Monkeys suggested sacrificing other community members to fuel the volcano's springs to the Lava Monkey of the shadows.</p><br/>
          <p className="story__text">Once the rogue monkey's radical plot was uncovered, they were banished to the dark regions of the volcanic springs.</p><br/>
          <p className="story__text">It is said that Snow Monkeys who venture too far into these forbidden regions are captured by this sect of Monkeys and are sacrificed to the Lava Monkey to heat the hot springs... There have also been rumours of mutated, infected snow monkeys who have risen from the shadows, be careful when you are in attendance, you never know when the temperature might drop and a sacrifice is required.”</p>
